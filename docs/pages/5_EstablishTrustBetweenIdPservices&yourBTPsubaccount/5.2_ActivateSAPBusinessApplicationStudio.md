## Activate SAP Business Application Studio 

As discussed in the previous section, we shall work with SAP Business Application Studio, Default Identity Provider, and assign the required roles to get access.  

**Add entitlements to your BTP subaccount** 

To set up access to SAP Business Application Studio, we need to add the entitlements to these services to the subaccount. 

Note: We are using the existing subaccounts that we created for activating the IAS tenants in the previous sections. Based on your project plan, you may prefer to create a subaccount based on service availability. Please refer to Data Center availability in the SAP Discovery Center.  

- Log in to your SAP BTP Global Account. Navigate to your subaccount.  

- Assign the entitlements for SAP Business Application Studio and SAP Build Work Zone (standard edition) to your subaccount. To do this, click on **Entitlements** -> Click on **Configure Entitlements**, and then click on **Add Service Plans**. A new window should pop up.
