## What is SAP Cloud Identity Service? 

SAP Cloud Identity Services is a group of services from the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP), which enable you to integrate identity and access management (IAM) between systems. The goal is to provide a seamless single sign-on (SSO) experience across systems, while ensuring that system and data access is secure. 

As you start your journey with the SAP Business Technology Platform or SAP Cloud Portfolio of services, users might have to remember multiple credentials, manage different logins, provisioning etc., which can be an arduous task. SAP Cloud Identity Services allows you to reduce the manual administration efforts for user management and identity provisioning to enable seamless access to your systems without disruption. SAP Cloud Identity Services is part of the Intelligent, sustainable enterprise helping you to achieve Consistent Security and Identity Management.
