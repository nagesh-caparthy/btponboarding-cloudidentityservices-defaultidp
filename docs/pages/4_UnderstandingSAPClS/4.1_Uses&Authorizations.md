## 1. Users and Authorizations  

Now that your tenant has been properly provisioned initial access is designated to one user as the tenant administrator. Due to security reasons, it is this personâ€™s exclusive responsibility to add additional administrators to the tenant. As a best practice, SAP recommends always having at least two administrators defined. 

Administrators
