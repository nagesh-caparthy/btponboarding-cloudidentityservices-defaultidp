  ## 1. Users and Authorizations  

Now that your tenant has been properly provisioned initial access is designated to one user as the tenant administrator. Due to security reasons, it is this personâ€™s exclusive responsibility to add additional administrators to the tenant. As a best practice, SAP recommends always having at least two administrators defined. 

Administrators 

Login to your Cloud Identity Services tenant https://<tenant ID>.accounts.ondemand.com/admin  

In the Users & Authorizations Section, select the Administrators tile
